# bare-surprise ![Make build](https://github.com/AlexTMjugador/bare-surprise/workflows/Make%20build/badge.svg)
A toy bootloader, operating system and graphical application made from scratch for a birthday surprise, whose total size is less than 12 KiB. That is smaller than a single JPEG image, and 10 times less than the amount of RAM found in a SNES.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build the minimum code necessary to get almost any x86 PC up and running without an OS from scratch, and display a small birthday greeting (referred to in the code as a _payload_) in the least amount of disk space possible. The congratulation itself is easily replaceable, so this project can serve as a basis for other similar, simple payloads.

Achieving this goal requires a thorough understanding of the x86 CPU architecture and the inner workings of the IBM PC. The following paragraphs are intended to help the reader understand the flow of events in the final result.

The first stage bootloader must be coded in x86 assembly because it needs direct access to the CPU registers and the INT instruction. Moreover, memory access registers are not yet configured (languages like C, even while they compile to machine code, can't run because the stack pointer register is not initialized). So, unsurprisingly, the first stage of this project's bootloader, which is contained in the MBR (so it can be 512 - 2 = 510 bytes at most) and loaded by the BIOS, sets up the stack and memory segment registers. In addition, it also checks whether VESA Bios Extensions 2.0 are supported, because they are needed for the payload, reads the second stage bootloader and payload from the next sectors on the disk, and jumps to the second stage bootloader.

The second stage bootloader, which is 512 bytes long, selects the first appropriate video mode for the payload using VBE 2.0 calls. If successful, it disables interrupts, enables the A20 line in a best effort (so that all memory is addressable), and loads a Global Descriptor Table, which contains information for the CPU on which regions of memory have what permissions and is needed to switch to 32-bit protected mode (for backward compatibility, all x86 CPUs start execution in 16-bit real mode, identical to the Intel 8086 used in the first IBM PC design). This mode is used to relax memory segmentation constraints and instead provide a flat memory model that is easier to work with. Most importantly, it is supported by most C compilers. Once the protected mode switch is complete, the 11 KiB C11 payload takes control.

The current payload configures the Interrupt Descriptor Table, the standard IBM PC interrupt controller, and the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) so that its interrupt service routine executes a tick function every 500 Âµs, which is used to update the screen. An implementation for an incredibly tiny subset of the standard C library functions was also coded. There are also functions for:

- _Decoding Portable Bit Map (PBM) images_. Designed primarily as an intermediate format, PBM encodes monochrome images in an extremely simple to parse way. Free and open source tools such as FFmpeg and GIMP can read and generate images in this format. Note that this implementation does not support comments, so they should be stripped from the file beforehand.
- _Run length encoding (RLE) decompression_. RLE techniques are extremely fast and simple to implement, while providing a > 2:1 compression ratio for the PBM images used in this project. The code for more sophisticated compression schemes would require so many instructions that the space efficiency advantage they provide would be neutralized.

## Building

For building the project, it is important to know that it is composed by several subprojects, each with its own Makefile:

- Main project: the root folder project contains the payload and bootloader.
- assets: the data that is intended to be included in the payload raw is put here. For now, they are PBM images. All these files are combined in an automatically generated C header file, `assets.h`, that is part of the resulting payload. That header allows accesing files at runtime like arrays.
- util: this auxiliary project contains the RLE compressor that will generate data suitable for decompressing with the provided decompressor (RLE is not a single standarized algorithm, so interoperability is a concern).

Dividing the project in subprojects eases creation and maintenance of Makefile scripts: the main project uses the other ones. Therefore, for generating the raw disk image suitable for writing on a hard disk, `build/disk.img`, it suffices with running Make in the root directory.

```console
you@computer:~/bare-surprise$ make
```

The following tools are required:
- GNU Make 4.2.1 or later (older or non-GNU variants will probably work, but were not tested).
- GCC 9 or later for x86 (older versions will probably work, but were not tested). **This project makes use of GCC specific extensions and it won't probably compile as-is with other compilers**.
- binutils 2.33.90 or later. This normally comes with GCC, and includes the GNU linker, for which there are specific linker scripts in this project.
- bbe 0.2.2 (for stripping the comment generated by GIMP from PBM files).
- Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.14.02 or later.

For testing, there are targets that launch `qemu-system-x86` with the resulting disk image, but otherwise QEMU is not necessary. Also, an Unix environment is assumed, with a POSIX shell at `/bin/sh`, and `sed` and `xxd` available.
